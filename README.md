## What is QuickSE?

**QuickSE** is a lightweight, open-source Android app that allows rooted users to **view**, **toggle**, and **automatically set** SELinux mode between **Enforcing** and **Permissive**, all in a modern Material You interface.  

Built with **Jetpack Compose** and **Kotlin**, it offers a fast, clean, and intuitive experience with just the essential tools you need.

---

## Requirements

- Android 7.1+ (API 25 or higher)
- Root access (required to change SELinux mode)

---

> SELinux mode resets on reboot unless you enable auto-toggle.
